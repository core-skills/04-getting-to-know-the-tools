# Core skills program - week 2 - Getting to know the tools

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/core-skills/02-getting-to-know-the-tools.git/master)

The aim of today's session will be to introduce methods to make sure that you're starting with quality data. As all data science methods are garbage in/garbage out you need to make sure you can explore new datasets quickly to assess whether your approach is viable. We will work towards building a basic exploratory data analysis framework with a checklist of things you should be looking out for.

You should aim to get familiar with `pandas`  interface for manipulating (munging) tabular data, learn how to create and interpret basic summary statistics, how to identify appropriate QA/QC, and have a basic understanding of 'tidy data' and data formats.

## Pre-session Reading & Resources

This week we're going to be looking at exploratory data with new datasets. You'll find that this process takes around 60-90% of any data science project so it's worth (a) getting good at it and (b) looking at ways to make this process easier. One approach is to put data in a *tidy form* as soon as possible. 

- Hadley Wickham (of R fame) wrote the original paper on this and you can read it here: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf
- There's a nice example of following this approach for a dataset in Python here: http://www.jeannicholashould.com/tidy-data-in-python.html

We're also going to be using some more advanced methods that `pandas` offers - you should aim to get as familiar with these as you can as it really is the swiss-army knife of data munging in Python. If you've used R before there will be a number of things that feel very familiar. There are a number of good technical resources online for getting your head around `pandas` which you might like to stack away for reference:

- Jake van der Plas has a very good book on data science with Python which has lots of examples using `pandas` - it's available as a series of Jupyter notebooks on GitHub here: https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook. You can buy a hard copy from O'Reilly Books here: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do.
- The pandas documentation is good if you want more info about a particular function (although less useful for how to piece everything together). It's available here: https://pandas.pydata.org
- If you get stuck then someone else has probably already had your problem and got it fixed on Stack Overflow - you can see questions tagged with `pandas` here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas


bogus change for git!
