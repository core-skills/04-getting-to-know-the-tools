    "# Munging tabular data\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to go through how to munge tabular data in more detail (and *slowly*). The aim is for you to get comfortable with the tools we're using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for basic plotting (but allows control of many details where needed)\n",
    "- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) for data handling (our dataframe library)\n",
    "- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) for _nice_ data visualization\n",
    "- [scipy](https://scipy.org) for scientific libraries (particularly `scipy.stats` which we'll use for fitting some more unusual probability distributions), and \n",
    "- [statsmodels](https://statsmodels.org) which gives us some more expressive curve fitting approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "The other aim is to get familiar with code-sharing workflows - so we will be doing pair programming for the duration of the day! \n",
    "\n",
    "*You will probably want to take a moment to look at the documentation of the libraries above - especially `pandas`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The other useful resource is Stack Overflow - if you have a question that sounds like 'how do I do {x}' then someone will probably have answered it on Stack Overflow. Questions are also tagged by library so if you have a particular pandas question you can do something like going to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas (just replace the 'pandas' in the URL with whatever library you're trying to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally answers on Stack Overflow are probably a lot closer to getting you up and running than the documentation. Once you get used to the library then the documentation is generally a quicker reference. We will cover strategies for getting help in class."
